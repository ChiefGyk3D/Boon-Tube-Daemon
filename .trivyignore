# CVE-2025-7709: SQLite FTS5 Integer Overflow
# Status: False positive / Low risk
# Reason: Python 3.14-slim base image ships with SQLite 3.46.1 from Debian trixie
# - The vulnerability requires specific FTS5 exploit conditions that don't apply to our use case
# - Debian security team has not issued an update, suggesting low real-world risk
# - Upgrading would require compiling SQLite from source and rebuilding Python's sqlite3 module
# - Risk vs effort tradeoff favors accepting this in production
# Mitigation: Monitor Debian security advisories for official patch
